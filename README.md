# TensorMSA : Tensorflow Micro Service Architecture 
<b>1.TensorMSA </b> </br>
   - Tensor Micro Service Architecture is a project started to make TensorFlow more accessable from Java legacy systems
   with out modifying too much source codes. 

<b>2. Function </b></br>
   - REST APIs corresponding to Tensorflow 
   - JAVA API component interface with python REST APIS
   - Easy to use UI component provide NN configuration, train remotly, save & load NN models, handling train data sets
   - Train NN models via Spark cluster supported 
   - Android mobile SDK are also part of the plan (gather data and predict) 
   
<b>3. Schedule </b></br>
   - We just started this projects (2016.8)
   - We are still on research process now
   - Expected to release first trial version on December 2016 

<b>4. Stack </b></br>
   - FE : React(ES6), SVG, D3, Pure CSS
   - BE : Django F/W, Tensorflow, PostgreSQL, Spark

<b>5. Methodology </b></br>
